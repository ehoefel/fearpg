## Introduction

### What is a tabletop RPG
  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game):
> A tabletop role-playing game is a form of role-playing game (RPG) in which
> the participants describe their characters' actions through speech.
> Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their
> characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a set formal
> system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the freedom to
> improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game.

  Tabletop RPGs are orchestrated in campaigns. A **campaign** is a set of game
  sessions where players partake in an exclusive journey, where their characters
  will experience and overtake the events and challenges that might come.

  An RPG campaign starts by designating one of the players to the special role
  of game master (GM), sometimes also known as the dungeon master (DM). The GM
  is responsible for preparing the game, narrating the story, and enforcing the
  game rules. The GM also acts as the final word during conflicts and to decide
  the outcome of events. While the other players each control one of the story
  protagonists, the GM role-plays and makes decisions for the other characters
  of the story, including enemies, hostages, traders and animals.
  The players are driven by the plot and storytelling of the GM to control
  and enact as a character that belongs to the story, influencing the direction
  and conclusion of the story.

  The rule set (hereby referred to as the **system**) guides the GM in creating
  a compelling and coherent adventure for the other players. It also establishes
  the freedoms and restrictions of the players, as well as the rules for
  interaction between player characters and the world they live. Besides a GM,
  an RPG system often requires other resources to be played, such as dice, pen
  and paper.

  The GM should be well habituated to the system in use and help the other
  players during the game. More complex systems might require that all players
  study the general rules before the game starts.

### Motivations

  It's no doubt that _Dungeons and Dragons_ is a huge phenomenom in nerd
  culture, bringing fantasy storytelling and roleplay to many game nights.
  But this classic RPG system is far from being the only available.
